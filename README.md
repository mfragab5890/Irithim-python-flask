## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Install the latest version of python for your platform.

#### Virtual Environment

working within a virtual environment keeps dependencies for the project separate and organized.

#### PIP Dependencies

Once we have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.
